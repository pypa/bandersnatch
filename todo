Must-be

- re-add signature checking
- locking method to avoid multiple synchronization runs
- fix ctrl-c during parallel thread-pool
- make master configurable (to support testing)
- review all scripts
- use config file
- flake8 check
- XXX review

Optional/Later

- continuous integration build
- try downloading actual files from other mirrors?
- use invisible dotfiles for temporary download, requests and large files?
- timeout control?
- ensure we show the right user agent
- can we get "scrub the mirror" in a reasonable performance?
    - walk all packages by assuming we haven't synced yet
    - remove packages that we missed deleting!


General algorithm

- determine working snapshot time
    - if we have a working snapshot time stored, use that
    - elif we have a finished snapshot time stored, use that
    - else use now

- determine list of packages we should update
    - use changelog since last finished snapshot time if we have ever finished
    - list all packages

- go through each package
    - update all release files, compare with response from server to avoid multiple downloads, delete files we don't see any longer
    - synchronize simple page
