; Number of worker threads to use for parallel downloads.
; Recommendations for worker thread setting:
; - leave the default of 3 to avoid overloading the pypi master
; - official servers located in data centers could run 10 workers
; - anything beyond 10 is probably unreasonable and avoided by bandersnatch

; Whether to hash package indexes
; Note that package index directory hashing is incompatible with pip, and so
; this should only be used in an environment where it is behind an application
; that can translate URIs to filesystem locations.  For example, with the
; following Apache RewriteRule:
;     RewriteRule ^([^/])([^/]*)/$ /mirror/pypi/web/simple/$1/$1$2/
;     RewriteRule ^([^/])([^/]*)/([^/]+)$/ /mirror/pypi/web/simple/$1/$1$2/$3
; OR
; following nginx rewrite rules:
;     rewrite ^/simple/([^/])([^/]*)/$ /simple/$1/$1$2/ last;
;     rewrite ^/simple/([^/])([^/]*)/([^/]+)$/ /simple/$1/$1$2/$3 last;
; Setting this to true would put the package 'abc' index in simple/a/abc.
; Recommended setting: the default of false for full pip/pypi compatibility.

; Number of prior simple index.html to store. Used as a safeguard against
; upstream changes generating blank index.html files. Prior versions are

; Configure a file to write out the list of files downloaded during the mirror.
; This is useful for situations when mirroring to offline systems where a process
; is required to only sync new files to the upstream mirror.
; The file be be named as set in the diff-file, and overwritten unless the
; diff-append-epoch setting is set to true.  If this is true, the epoch date will
; be appended to the filename (i.e. /path/to/diff-1568129735)

; directory to keep the diff file, separated by an _ character in-
; e.g. {{mirror_directory}}

; Configure an option to compare whether a file is identical. By default the
; "hash" method is used which reads local file content and computes hashes,
; which is slow but more reliable; when "stat" method is used, file size and
; change time are used to compare, which is useful to reduce IO workload when
; verifying a lot of files frequently.
; Possible values are: hash (default), stat
