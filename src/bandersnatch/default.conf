; The network socket timeout to use for all connections. This is set to a

; Number of worker threads to use for parallel downloads.
; Recommendations for worker thread setting:
; - leave the default of 3 to avoid overloading the pypi master
; - official servers located in data centers could run 10 workers
; - anything beyond 10 is probably unreasonable and avoided by bandersnatch

; Whether to hash package indexes
; Note that package index directory hashing is incompatible with pip, and so
; this should only be used in an environment where it is behind an application
; that can translate URIs to filesystem locations.  For example, with the
; following Apache RewriteRule:
;     RewriteRule ^([^/])([^/]*)/$ /mirror/pypi/web/simple/$1/$1$2/
;     RewriteRule ^([^/])([^/]*)/([^/]+)$/ /mirror/pypi/web/simple/$1/$1$2/$3
; OR
; following nginx rewrite rules:
;     rewrite ^/simple/([^/])([^/]*)/$ /simple/$1/$1$2/ last;
;     rewrite ^/simple/([^/])([^/]*)/([^/]+)$/ /simple/$1/$1$2/$3 last;
; Setting this to true would put the package 'abc' index in simple/a/abc.
; Recommended setting: the default of false for full pip/pypi compatibility.

; Number of prior simple index.html to store. Used as a safeguard against
; upstream changes generating blank index.html files. Prior versions are
; stored under as "versions/index_<serial>_<timestamp>.html" and the current
; index.html will be a symlink to the latest version.
; If set to 0 no prior versions are stored and index.html is the latest version.
; If unset defaults to 0.
