; the client soon instead of having a process hang infinitely and have TCP not

; Number of worker threads to use for parallel downloads.
; Recommendations for worker thread setting:
; - leave the default of 3 to avoid overloading the pypi master
; - official servers located in data centers could run 10 workers
; - anything beyond 10 is probably unreasonable and avoided by bandersnatch

; Whether to hash package indexes
; Note that package index directory hashing is incompatible with pip, and so
; this should only be used in an environment where it is behind an application
; that can translate URIs to filesystem locations.  For example, with the
; following Apache RewriteRule:
;     RewriteRule ^([^/])([^/]*)/$ /mirror/pypi/web/simple/$1/$1$2/
;     RewriteRule ^([^/])([^/]*)/([^/]+)$/ /mirror/pypi/web/simple/$1/$1$2/$3
; Setting this to true would put the package 'abc' index in simple/a/abc.
; Recommended setting: the default of false for full pip/pypi compatability.

; Whether to stop a sync quickly after an error is found or whether to continue
; syncing but not marking the sync as successful. Value should be "true" or

; on the mirror, too.
; IMPORTANT: if you are running an official mirror than you *need* to leave
; this on.
