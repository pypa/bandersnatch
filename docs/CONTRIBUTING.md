So you want to help out? **Awesome**. Go you!

## Getting Started


### Pre Install
Please make sure you system has the following:

- Python 3.5 or greater
- Git installed

### Clone `bandersnatch`

First clone the bandersnatch repo.

- `git clone `

### Development venv

One way to develop and install all the dependencies of bandersnatch is to use a venv.

- Lets create one and upgrade `pip`

```
python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
/path/to/venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
```

- Then we should install the dependencies to the venv:

```
/path/to/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
/path/to/venv/bin/pip install -r test-requirements.txt
```

## Running Bandersnatch

You will need to customize `src/bandersnatch/default.conf` and run via the following:

**WARNING: Bandersnatch will go off and sync from pypi.org and use disk space!**

```
cd bandersnatch
/path/to/venv/bin/pip install --upgrade .
/path/to/venv/bin/bandersnatch --help

/path/to/venv/bin/bandersnatch -c src/bandersnatch/default.conf mirror
```

## Running Unit Tests

We use tox to run tests. `tox.ini` has the options needed, so running tests is very easy.

```
cd bandersnatch
/path/to/venv/bin/tox [-vv]
```

You want to see:
```
py36: commands succeeded
congratulations :)
```
