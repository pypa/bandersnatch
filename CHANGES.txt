1.11 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Fix an edge case: IO errors while marking off packages as "done"
  could result in crashing workers that would result in bandersnatch
  getting stuck. Thanks @wjjt!


1.10.0.1 (2016-05-11)
---------------------

- Brownbag release for re-upload. My train's Wifi broke while uploading
  ending up with a partial file on PyPI. Can your train service do better
  than mine?


1.10 (2016-05-11)
-----------------

This is release is massively supported by @dstufft getting bandersnatch
back in sync with current packaging ecosystem changes. All clap your hands
now, please.

- Refactor the generation update code to avoid weird update paths
  due to, well, my personal kink: overcomplication.

- Generate the simple index ourselves instead of copying it from PyPI.

- Support files hosted on a separate domain.

- Implement PEP 503 normalization rules while also providing support
  for legacy and very legacy clients.


1.9 (2016-04-21)
----------------

- Fix a long standing, misunderstood bug: a non-deleting mirror would
  delete packages if they were fully removed from PyPI. (#61)


1.8 (2015-03-16)
----------------

- Don't require a X-PyPI-Last-Serial header on file downloads.
  (Thanks to @dstufft.)

- Increase our generation to help mirrors recover potential
  setuptools corruption after some data bug on PyPI.


1.7 (2014-12-14)
----------------

- Fix #54 by reordering the simple index page and file fetching
  parts. Thanks @dstufft for the inspiration.

- Stop syncing serversig files and even start removing them.


1.6.1 (2014-09-24)
------------------

- Create a new generation to enforce a full sync when upgrading.
  This is required to get the canonical names for all packages.

1.6 (2014-09-24)
----------------

- Implement canonical package directory names to support an upcoming PIP
  release and other tools. (Thanks to @dstufft)

- Fix a race condition where workers could get stuck indefinitely waiting for
  another item in a depleted queue. (Thanks to hongqn)

1.5 (2014-07-21)
----------------

- Delete broken tests that I forgot to remove.

- Reduce the officially sanctioned maximum number of connections.

1.4 (2014-04-15)
----------------

- Move towards replacing the XMLRPC API with JSON to make our requests
  cacheable. Also reduces the amount of requests needed dramatically.

- Remove apache stats script as this information is no longer being used anyway.

1.3 (2014-02-16)
----------------

- Move to xmlrpc2 to get SSL verification on XML-RPC calls, too. (Fixes #40 and
  big thanks to @ewdurbin)

1.2 (2014-01-08)
----------------

- Potential performance improvement: use requests' session object to allow HTTP
  pipelining. Thanks to Wouter Bolsterlee for the recommendation in #39.


1.1 (2013-11-26)
----------------

- Made code Python 2.6 compatible. Thanks to @ewdurbin for the pull request.


1.0.5 (2013-07-25)
------------------

- Refactor lock acquisition to avoid shadowing exceptions when creating the
  lockfile vs. acquiring the lock.

- Move from distribute back to setuptools.


1.0.4 (2013-07-10)
------------------

- Slight brownbag release: the requirements.txt accidentally included a
  development version of py.test due to my usage of mr.developer.

1.0.3 (2013-07-08)
------------------

- Fix brownbag release with broken 'stable' tag and missing requirements.txt
  update.


1.0.2 (2013-07-08)
------------------

- Generate the index simple page ourselves: its not signed anyway and helps
  PyPI caching more aggressively.

- Add a py.test plugin to actually show a green bar. Hopefully will be
  integrated into py.test in the near future.

- Fix dealing with inconsistent todo files: empty files or with an incorrect
  header will just be deleted and processing resumes at the last known good
  state.

- Mark up requirement of Python 2.7 (#19)

- Fix dealing with new CDN cache issues. Thanks to @dstufft for making PyPI
  support mirrors again.

- Improve test coverage.

1.0.1 (2013-04-18)
------------------

- Fix packaging: include default config file. (Thanks to Jannis Leidel)


1.0 (2013-04-09)
----------------

- Update pip install documentation to use the a URL for referring to the
  requirements.txt directly.

- Adjust buildout and jenkins job to stop fighting over the distribute version
  to install.

1.0rc6 (2013-04-09)
-------------------

- Hopefully fixed updating the stable tag when releasing.


1.0rc5 (2013-04-09)
-------------------

- Experiment with zest.releaser integration to automatically generate
  requirements.txt during release process.


1.0rc4 (2013-04-09)
-------------------

- Experiment with zest.releaser integration to automatically generate
  requirements.txt during release process.


1.0rc3 (2013-04-09)

- Experiment with zest.releaser integration to automatically generate
  requirements.txt during release process.


1.0rc2 (2013-04-09)
-------------------

- Experiment with zest.releaser integration to automatically generate
  requirements.txt during release process.


1.0rc1 (2013-04-09)
