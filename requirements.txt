idna==2.10  # pyup: ignore
            # idna 3 and above causes some extreme backtracking because
            # requests doesn't support the 3.x series. Requests is
            # heavily used by dependencies needed for bandersnatch
            # swift support so when requests must downgrade to a
            # version that vendors idna, dependency tree turns into a
            # variant that pip's new dependency resolver doesn't like
            # resolving. Although not installing the swift dependencies
            # or using the unpinned dependencies info in setup.cfg
            # works properly.
